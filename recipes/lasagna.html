        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups dried malfada noodles</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Drain and discard grease. 
                Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper.

            <l1>
                    Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. 
                    Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
            </l1>
            <li>
                    Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.
